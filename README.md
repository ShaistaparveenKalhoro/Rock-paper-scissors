# Guess the Number Game

A Python game where the computer tries to guess a number that the user has in mind.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll build a guessing game where the computer attempts to guess a number that the user is thinking of. The user provides feedback after each guess (higher, lower, or correct) to help the computer narrow down the correct number.

## Features

- The computer makes intelligent guesses based on user feedback
- Tracks the number of attempts made
- Handles invalid user input
- Option to play multiple rounds

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script: `python app.py`
2. Think of a number between 1 and 100
3. After each guess, tell the computer if your number is:
   - `higher` - if your number is greater than the guess
   - `lower` - if your number is less than the guess
   - `correct` - if the computer guessed your number
4. The game will tell you how many attempts it took to guess your number
5. Choose whether to play again

## Learning Objectives

This project helps you learn:
- Working with Python's `random` module
- Building functions
- Using while loops and conditionals
- Getting user input
- Error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Running the Game

```bash
python app.py
```
